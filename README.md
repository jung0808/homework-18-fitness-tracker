# Homework-18: Fitness-Tracker

# Description

This was my homework #18 Fitness Tracker. I was tasked with creating a workout tracker. This code gave me a starter code which was mainly the front end, and the portion that I had to do was creating the models + routes + and server.js.

I first started this homework by creating the models folder and creating index.js and workout.js. The workout.js contains the Mongoose database schema's in order to get the project started. Next I created the routes folder, and created htmlRoutes, and apiRoutes. htmlRoutes was pretty much straight forward; however apiRoutes was more difficult to create and work with. Especially in the apiRoutes file, the last get method to get the last 7 days workout was the most difficult to implement.

After doing this, I installed all of the dependencies in my package.json folder. After all of the dependencies have been installed, I ran "node server.js". After that, I went to my browser localhost:3001, to view the application. After checking the browser, all of the functionality is working the way its supposed to since all of the routes inside apiRoutes.js have been implemented correctly.

# Installation

1. Please type in "npm i" <br>
2. Run the code by typing "node server.js"
3. Open Insomnia and try playing with CRUD under different api routes. (If needed).
